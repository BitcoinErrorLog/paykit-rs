3. **Directory Operations** (`DirectoryService.swift` or equivalent)
   - **Current**: ✅ Configurable mock/callback transport
   - **Should Be**: Real Pubky transport integration (implement callback)
   - **Priority**: Medium (transport ready, need Pubky SDK integration)

4. **Payment Method Selection**

### 3.2 Features That Are Appropriately Mocked (Demo Limitations)

These are acceptable for demo purposes:

1. **Payment Execution** (Web, Mobile)
   - Cannot execute real payments without wallet integration
   - Demo limitation is appropriate

2. **Noise Payments** (Mobile)
   - Requires WebSocket/TCP transport which is complex on mobile
   - Demo limitation is acceptable

3. **Key Storage** (Web)
   - localStorage is appropriate for browser demo
   - Production would use secure storage

## 7. Implementation Recommendations

### 7.1 Mobile FFI Integration Pattern

**Recommended Approach**:

```swift
// iOS Example
class PaymentMethodsViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let paykitClient: PaykitClient
    
    @Published var methods: [PaymentMethod] = []
    @Published var healthStatus: [String: HealthStatus] = [:]
    
    init() {
        self.paykitClient = PaykitClient()
        loadMethods()
        checkHealth()
    }
    
    func loadMethods() {
        let methods = paykitClient.listMethods()
        // Convert to UI models
        self.methods = methods.map { methodId in
            PaymentMethod(id: methodId, health: healthStatus[methodId])
        }
    }
    
    func checkHealth() {
        let results = paykitClient.checkHealth()
        for result in results {
            healthStatus[result.methodId] = result.status
        }
    }
}
```

### 7.2 Directory Transport Integration

**Recommended Approach**:

1. Create a Pubky session wrapper that implements `AuthenticatedTransportFFI`
2. Use real Pubky SDK for authenticated operations
3. Use `PubkyUnauthenticatedTransport` for read operations
4. Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages

### 7.3 Web Publishing Solution

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **Option A**: Use a CORS proxy service (e.g., `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`)
2. **Option B**: Configure Pubky homeserver with CORS headers
3. **Option C**: Use a backend proxy endpoint

**Recommendation**: Option B (configure homeserver) for production demos, Option A for quick testing

---

## 8. Testing Strategy

---

## 10. Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Mobile FFI Integration
- **Duration**: 3-4 weeks
- **Resources**: 1 developer per platform (iOS/Android)

### Phase 2: Web Real Publishing
- **Duration**: 1 week
- **Resources**: 1 developer

### Phase 3: Mobile Payment Requests & Receipts
- **Duration**: 2 weeks
- **Resources**: 1 developer per platform

### Phase 4: README Updates
- **Duration**: 2 days
- **Resources**: 1 developer

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 6-7 weeks with parallel development

---

## 11. Risk Assessment

### High Risk

1. **Pubky Transport Integration** (Mobile)
   - **Risk**: Complex integration, may require Pubky SDK updates
   - **Mitigation**: Start with mock transport, gradually replace with real

2. **CORS Issues** (Web)
   - **Risk**: Browser security restrictions
   - **Mitigation**: Use proxy or configure homeserver properly

### Medium Risk

1. **FFI Performance** (Mobile)
   - **Risk**: FFI calls may be slow, blocking UI
   - **Mitigation**: Use async/await, show loading states

2. **Error Handling** (All)
   - **Risk**: Complex error scenarios not handled
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling, user-friendly messages

---

## 12. Conclusion

The Paykit demo applications are in good shape overall, with the CLI demo serving as the reference implementation. The main gaps are:

1. **Mobile demos** need FFI integration to use real Paykit functionality
2. **Web demo** needs real directory publishing (currently mocked)
3. **All demos** could better utilize library features

The plan outlined above provides a clear path to feature parity and optimal demo capability. The estimated timeline of 6-7 weeks is reasonable with proper resource allocation.

**Next Steps**:
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Prioritize phases based on business needs
3. Assign developers to each phase
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
